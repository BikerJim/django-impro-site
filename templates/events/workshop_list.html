<h2>Drop-in Improv Workshops</h2>
<ul>
	<li>When: every Sunday afternoon 12:00-14:00</li>
	<li>Cost: â‚¬10 (pay at the workshop, no need to reserve) or see below for strippenkaart prices.</li>

<p>
If you have always wanted to try improv, if you have taken a class and 
would like to continue growing your skills or if you simply want to enjoy 
a couple of hours of fun and laughter with like-minded people, easylaughs
 offers drop-in improv workshops in English every Sunday afternoon where
  everyone is welcome and no experience is required.
</p>
<p>
Each workshop is run by a different member of easylaughs 
(or occasionally a guest) who gives it a new theme from learning the basics
 and playing games to getting into a particular aspect of improv performance.
</p>
