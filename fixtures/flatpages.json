High energy and highly interactive, easylaughs performs every Friday night at the Crea Cafe. easylaughs also offers a full range of courses and every Sunday a walk-in improv workshop for all levels of experience. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\neasylaughs is an international improvised comedy group based in Amsterdam. Many of the players are full-time actors and theater teachers and several of the cast have been playing together for more than 10 years. The cast includes: Peter More, Jochem Meijer, Ben Silburn, Sarah Grimmer, Trista Mrema, Luke Davies, Ashley Moore, Jim Buddin, Anne de Graaf, Jake Goshert and Janette Warburton. The cast is international with 2 Dutch, 4 British, 2 Americans, 1 Australian, and a New Zealander. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cast includes voice actors, television presenters and writers. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cozy and welcoming atmosphere of the Crea cafe works hand in hand with the community based structure of easylaughs. For over 7 years easylaughs has provided Amsterdam with an affordable and intimate improv comedy experience as well as doing more to foster a community than any other group. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>History</h3>\r\n<p>\r\neasylaughs formed in the spring of 2005 from the highly successful group, Problem Solved which formed out of the keen followers of an improv course in 2000. Joined by other performers trained in other parts of the world, they started performing at the Cameleon Theater in Amsterdam. The show became more frequent until they established a regular show once a month at the Cameleon. Here they also taught courses and ran weekly open workshops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The easylaughs group formed to make the shows weekly and this needed a change of venue, so they moved to the old Crea. When the Crea moved in 2012, easylaughs moved with them. Now they perform a show every Friday night at the Crea, as well as continuing to run courses and workshops.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Press Pack</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"{{ STATIC_URL }}doc/easylaughs_press_pack.pdf\">Download the Press Pack Text (English) PDF</a> here and click on the photos below.

You may have already seen it on \"Whose Line is it Anyway?\" or \"de Lamas.\"</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt is a great way to explore your creativity, gain confidence and develop presentation, spontaneity and teamwork skills in a way that has benefits in all parts of life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is Stand-up Comedy?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nIn Stand-up Comedy you perform alone, using material prepared and developed from your life experiences, unique points of view and personal observations.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt is a great way to explore your creativity, gain confidence, develop presentation skills and discover a lot about yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How many people are there in a course?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nTypically a course has a minimum of 6 up to a maximum of 12. Some specialised courses have a maximum of 8 or 10.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>English is my second language; is that a problem?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nNo. Many people who do our courses who are not native speakers of English. Whilst you should have a reasonable understanding of it, improv is not just a verbal medium but also involves physical movement and much non-verbal communication.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Can I pay by credit card or PIN?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nNo, sorry. We are not set up to accept credit card or PIN payments.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>I don't have a Dutch bank account yet, can I pay by cash?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nIn certain circumstances, we do accept cash. Payable by the first day of the class. Contact us for more information.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How do I pay?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nPlease see our terms and conditions page for payment instructions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What sort of people take the courses?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nAnyone. Participants are typically 20-45 years old, men or women, and from Earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Is the course active?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nImprovised Comedy does involve a fair bit of movement, which doesn't mean you have to be fit, but does require a fair bit of mobility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stand-up doesn't require that. In fact, despite the name, you don't have to stand up, even.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>I'm very nervous about performing on stage, is this a problem?</h3>\r\n<p>This is quite normal. It's perfectly natural to be nervous when performing (or doing anything) in front of a crowd of people. We make sure that during the course you learn skills that will give you confidence to perform on stage. Plus we make sure the class and performing environment is as safe as possible. Most classes have an end-of-course performance. This is not compulsory, but even those people who started the course dreading it, look forward to it by the end of the course.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Can easylaughs organise a workshop for my company or event?</h3>\r\n<p>Yes we can. Improv is great for improving communications and teambuilding and we offer several types of workshops geared to specific needs. Check out our Corporate page or contact us for information on what we can do for you.</p>",
